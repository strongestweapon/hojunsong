Hojun Song’s work constructs narratives and raises questions through the creation of absurd objects—such as radiation jewelry or “the strongest weapon in the world”—and through semi-functional organizations like the Open Source Satellite Initiative. In 2013, he launched his own small satellite from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. This satellite project spans DIY engineering, merchandise such as T-shirts, and public engagement, challenging stereotypical perceptions of space programs.

His recent works explore the ironic relationship between romanticism and deconstructionism, examining how societies create heroes and how those heroes can suppress diversity. Drawing on contemporary scientific and technological discourses—such as artificial intelligence, complex systems, and blockchain—his practice embraces uncertainty and decentralization.

Rather than confining his work to museums or galleries, Song situates it within society through live streaming, sound performance, mass production, commerce, and hands-on engineering, using humor to question conventional ideas of art, design, and technology while connecting them to everyday life.
