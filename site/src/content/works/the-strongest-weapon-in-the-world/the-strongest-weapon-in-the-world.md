A series of attempts to build an indestructible weapon that does NOT attack. The first version, Weapons of Mass Happiness, was a heavy cast-aluminum sphere with a Geiger counter and a printer that outputs messages when triggered by nuclear explosion. 

The second was built with K-SAD students, featuring letters engraved on cow bones—emphasizing that indestructible data is the ultimate weapon. 

In 2010, the third version appeared: I Love You. Armored in thick SC45 steel with a piezo sensor inside, it says "I love you" when struck with a hammer.
