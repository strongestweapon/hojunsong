## Overview
On Off Everything, a new project by media artist Hojun Song, is an exhibition that repeatedly turns electronic and mechanical devices on and off. The artist’s core approach—creating narratives through technology—lies in hoping that the simultaneous switching on and off of multiple devices resonates with the many stories of the world. In this exhibition, Song explores unexpected synesthetic effects through combinations and operations of various devices.

The first edition of On Off Everything begins at the space “Mumokjeok.”

Fifty power outlets are waiting for you.

- Dates: July 26–28
- Opening Party: July 26, 8:00 PM (DJ Jeon yonghyeon)
