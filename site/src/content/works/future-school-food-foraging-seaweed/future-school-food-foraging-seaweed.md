Seaweeds like Miyeok (Undaria pinnatifida) and Dasima (Laminaria japonica) travel with ocean currents and settle wherever they land. Now considered among the most invasive species globally, they are also traditional postpartum food in Korea.

We know that ocean seaweed captures more carbon than the Amazon rainforest, yet few international institutions officially recognize this.

It's striking how this seemingly insignificant seaweed connects to major global issues: future food, climate change, decolonization, and diaspora.
