![LED That Blinks Once Every 100 Years Proposal, 2014](100yearsLEDAssem3.jpg)

A small, cheap 5mm LED that blinks once every 100 years. The idea began in 2010 and nearly became a public art project in 2015. A two-meter spherical structure would house an LED module in an inert gas-filled vacuum chamber. Nuclear batteries would provide 100 years of power, with a passive heating system designed through thermal simulation. The project was rejected after Hojun Song refused the committee's proposal to make it blink every year.

Twelve years later in 2026, [the first version](/works/led-that-blinks-once-every-100-years/2025-Ver001/) was built. 

> The first light was emitted at 8:00 PM on January 14, 2026. The next blink will occur at the same time on **January 14, 2126**.
