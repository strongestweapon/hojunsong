A performance at the opening of MMCA Seoul. Collaborating with actor Taeyoung Kang, actress Eun-ah Suh, and the band Idiotape, the show explored deconstructing the authority of previous artworks to create new ones. It began with LED poets spouting nonsense, moved through improvised confessions via computer chat, calling out every audience member's name, and flower-rope suicides, ending with loud music in the quiet museum. Deliberately clumsy graphics and fake sculptures were displayed prominently while technology stayed hidden. Only 3 of hundreds danced.
