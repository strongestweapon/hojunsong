Even after the Trinity test revealed the bomb's power, and even after Germany's defeat, the Manhattan Project continued—dropping nuclear bombs on two Japanese cities. Many scientists, including Einstein, later expressed regret. But the question remains: couldn't these geniuses have stopped it before the bombing? 

In this installation, as viewers examine a tiny, gold-framed text about the Manhattan Project up close, a nearby video of Einstein transitions from his normal expression to his famous tongue-out gesture—supposedly made "for humanity." Gotcha!
