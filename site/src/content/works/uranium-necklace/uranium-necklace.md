Uranium Necklace is for those contemplating suicide—a way to taste death before making a final decision. Drugs aren't potent enough; we need stronger materials. Upon purchase, the stainless steel wire necklace is locked so it cannot be removed. An attempt to sell one on eBay for $900,000 drew a comment that a life was worth less.
