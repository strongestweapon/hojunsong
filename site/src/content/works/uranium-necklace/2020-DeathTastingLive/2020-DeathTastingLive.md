## Overview
The Uranium Necklace is a necklace for people who wish to die, created by artist Hojun Song using actual uranium ore, gold, and stainless steel wire.

As part of the “Eulji Drama” event, this program offers participants the opportunity to directly experience “death tasting” by wearing the Uranium Necklace for 10 minutes.

Through one-on-one conversations with the artist about death, the event aims to explore clichéd yet fundamental questions in a lighthearted manner.

A total of five participants will be selected, and each selected participant will be provided with a photograph of themselves wearing the Uranium Necklace.

The event will be live-streamed online, and voice modulation and mosaic masking are available upon the participant’s request.
