## Overview


[video][Uranium Necklace Blackout Basel, 2015](0129_web.mp4)


Uranium Necklace exhibited in an attic opened to the public for the first time in several hundred years.

Some audiences contacted the organizers afterward to ask whether their health was safe.

It was actually safe—the radiation level of the uranium ore was comparable to everyday exposure—but saying that would undermine the work.
