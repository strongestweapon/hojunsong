## Overview
Don't Compress Me Competition Head Only Version at Blackout Basel, Basel, Switzerland, 2015

Unlike the regular "Don't Compress Me" competition where participants use their entire body, this version requires participants to move only their head for 10 seconds to resist video compression.

Artists from various countries participated in the competition, and certain patterns seemed to emerge in their movements and sound.
