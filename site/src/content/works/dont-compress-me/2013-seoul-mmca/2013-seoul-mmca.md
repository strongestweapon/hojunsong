## Overview

Interactive installation presented at the opening of MMCA Seoul. Participants stood in front of a camera and moved freely for 10 seconds. Their video was compressed in real-time, and the file size determined their score.

## Context

The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Seoul opened in 2013. This work was part of the opening exhibition exploring the relationship between humans and digital technology.

## Focus

This version emphasized the competitive aspect—turning compression resistance into a game. A leaderboard displayed the top scores, encouraging repeated attempts.

## Development

Built with Processing and FFmpeg. The system captured video, applied H.264 compression, measured file size, and displayed results in under 3 seconds.
