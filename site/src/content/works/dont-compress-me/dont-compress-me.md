Participants try to create movements for 10 seconds that resist video compression. They stand before a camera and record; the person whose video stays largest after compression wins.

Random movements should defeat codecs like H.264, but there's an irony: once people consciously try to be random, they can't truly be random.

How can we move and think beyond A.I. predictions?
