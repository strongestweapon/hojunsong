gold & silver is a two-member experimental improvisation band: Hojun Song and Sangback Choe. The band makes experimental music accessible by actively explaining what they're doing and why during performances.

They share improvised song titles and the thinking behind them, helping audiences imagine along. When it works, audiences can even sing along to improvised sounds.

The band has charged negative admission—paying audiences to attend—so they can fail freely without guilt. Current setup: modular synthesizers and acoustic drums.
