## Overview
The core idea of the OSSI satellite project is to share the entire process of building and launching a satellite. Therefore, even though it was presented in a renowned exhibition such as Art Spectrum, the work was presented in a deliberately approachable and accessible manner. The main idea behind the presentation format was inspired by kiosks found in local community offices and post offices. 

By encouraging active audience participation—watching videos and solving quizzes—the project aimed to help viewers realize that the technologies discussed in the satellite project are in fact connected to broader themes such as society, politics, and people’s dreams.

Before the exhibition, more than 100 elementary school students in Seoul sent handwritten letters titled “To Scientist Hojun Song, Who Launched a Satellite into Space.” The students and their science teacher were invited to the art exhibition, where a gathering was held to share conversations together.
