## Overview
OSSI-1 Satellite Manufacturing Techniques, 2015

This work presents stories about manufacturing techniques based on practical knowledge of satellite construction. Rather than focusing on the operating principles of satellites, it highlights hands-on processes such as wire selection, wire stripping, soldering, aluminum machining, spring fabrication, antenna making, and selecting adhesives capable of functioning in space.

These forms of practical knowledge—often referred to as know-how—are much harder to find than theoretical principles organized in textbooks. The exhibition presents actual fabricated satellite components alongside stories of the people, communities, and online knowledge encountered throughout the production process.
