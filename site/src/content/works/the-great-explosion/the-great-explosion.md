This project collects participants' voices as material for an explosion simulation. Voices are mapped to fragment energies and trajectories, then detonated.

The noise of all voices playing at once, the overloaded computer, and visuals shifting between order and chaos invite us to think about the space between simulated disasters and real ones like COVID-19.
