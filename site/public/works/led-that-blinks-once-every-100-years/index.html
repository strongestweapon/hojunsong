  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>A small, cheap 5mm LED that blinks once every 100 years. The idea began in 2010 and nearly became a public art project in 2015. A two-meter spherical structure would house an LED module in an inert gas-filled vacuum chamber. Nuclear batteries would provide 100 years of power, with a passive heating system designed through thermal simulation. The project was rejected after Hojun Song refused the committee's proposal to make it blink every year.</p>
