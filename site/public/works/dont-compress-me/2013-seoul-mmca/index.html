  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Interactive installation presented at the opening of MMCA Seoul. Participants stood in front of a camera and moved freely for 10 seconds. Their video was compressed in real-time, and the file size determined their score.</p>
</div>

<div class="work">
  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Seoul opened in 2013. This work was part of the opening exhibition exploring the relationship between humans and digital technology.</p>
</div>

<div class="work">
  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>This version emphasized the competitive aspect—turning compression resistance into a game. A leaderboard displayed the top scores, encouraging repeated attempts.</p>
</div>

<div class="work">
  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>Built with Processing and FFmpeg. The system captured video, applied H.264 compression, measured file size, and displayed results in under 3 seconds.</p>
