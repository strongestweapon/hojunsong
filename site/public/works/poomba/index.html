  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Winner of the Ilmac Art Prize 2015, Hojun Song's solo exhibition featured no physical artworks. Deconstructing heroes and restoring romance collided—the artist could only ask questions, since making and showing things felt like violence. The poomba was a Korean figure from the late Goryeo dynasty: satirist, clown, beggar, and street monk, respected for wisdom. A self-deprecating, hero-deconstructing hero. The exhibition explored what a future poomba might be. Four talks and four workshops were held at the gallery and a nearby construction site, all live-streamed. Activities included camping and swimming at the construction site, with nightly gatherings for drinks.</p>
