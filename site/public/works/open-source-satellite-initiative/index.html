  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Hojun Song launched the OSSI-1 satellite in April 2013 at Baikonur, Kazakhstan—the first satellite ever built and launched by an individual.</p>
<p>While audiences are drawn to this achievement, Hojun Song shifts attention to broader themes: heroism and nationalism in science, the role of amateurs today, and the sharing of sensitive technologies. He explores these ideas through comedic and satirical performances.</p>
