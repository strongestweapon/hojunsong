  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This project uses a sailboat as a floating, isolated studio for near-future storytelling. It explores off-grid ocean living in an era of pandemics and virtual reality.</p>
<p>Scientists, artists, musicians, and writers sail together to create a short science fiction zine. Conversations on board are live-streamed for real-time collaboration with audiences. The sailing and publishing happen quarterly.</p>
