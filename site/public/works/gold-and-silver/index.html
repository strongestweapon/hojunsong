  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>gold &amp; silver is a two-member experimental improvisation band: Hojun Song and Sangback Choe. The band makes experimental music accessible by actively explaining what they're doing and why during performances.</p>
  <p>They share improvised song titles and the thinking behind them, helping audiences imagine along. When it works, audiences can even sing along to improvised sounds.</p>
  <p>The band has charged negative admission—paying audiences to attend—so they can fail freely without guilt. Current setup: modular synthesizers and acoustic drums.</p>
