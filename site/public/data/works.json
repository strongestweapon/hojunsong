Therefore, even though it was presented in a renowned exhibition such as Art Spectrum, the work was presented in a deliberately approachable and accessible manner. The main idea behind the presentation format was inspired by kiosks found in local community offices and post offices. \nBy encouraging active audience participation—watching videos and solving quizzes—the project aimed to help viewers realize that the technologies discussed in the satellite project are in fact connected to broader themes such as society, politics, and people’s dreams.\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](QuizShowLeeum.jpg)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](OSSIQuizshowPeople.JPG)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](OSSIQuizshowPeople2.JPG)\n![Elementary School Field Trip for Satellite Quiz Show](OSSIQuizshowSchool.jpeg)\nBefore the exhibition, more than 100 elementary school students in Seoul sent handwritten letters titled “To Scientist Hojun Song, Who Launched a Satellite into Space.” The students and their science teacher were invited to the art exhibition, where a gathering was held to share conversations together.\n![Quiz Show Prize](OSSIQuizshowPresent1.JPG)\n![Quiz Show Prize](OSSIQuizshowPresent2.JPG)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Drawing LIVE](OSSIQuizShow.JPG)\n[grid-2]\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 1](OSSIQuiz1.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 2](OSSIQuiz2.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 3](OSSIQuiz3.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 4](OSSIQuiz4.jpg)\n[/grid]\n[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wArISD9NJ_8)"

Rather than focusing on the operating principles of satellites, it highlights hands-on processes such as wire selection, wire stripping, soldering, aluminum machining, spring fabrication, antenna making, and selecting adhesives capable of functioning in space. \nThese forms of practical knowledge—often referred to as know-how—are much harder to find than theoretical principles organized in textbooks. The exhibition presents actual fabricated satellite components alongside stories of the people, communities, and online knowledge encountered throughout the production process."
