Why do few care about air bending while nations spend billions on the LHC at CERN? Is this about pseudoscience versus real science? Or about what actually improves the world? What is \"betterment\"? Experts prove; people believe—because most can't understand either way. The project places different \"proofs\" side by side: air bending vs. LHC, a man hiking with an atomic clock to feel time, human echolocation by blind people, a Dynasphere machine generating love Qi for world peace, quantum consciousness, and more. *The exhibition was never realized due to a change in director."
