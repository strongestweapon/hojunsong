Therefore, even though it was presented in a renowned exhibition such as Art Spectrum, the work was presented in a deliberately approachable and accessible manner. The main idea behind the presentation format was inspired by kiosks found in local community offices and post offices. \nBy encouraging active audience participation—watching videos and solving quizzes—the project aimed to help viewers realize that the technologies discussed in the satellite project are in fact connected to broader themes such as society, politics, and people’s dreams.\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](QuizShowLeeum.jpg)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](OSSIQuizshowPeople.JPG)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](OSSIQuizshowPeople2.JPG)\n![Elementary School Field Trip for Satellite Quiz Show](OSSIQuizshowSchool.jpeg)\nBefore the exhibition, more than 100 elementary school students in Seoul sent handwritten letters titled “To Scientist Hojun Song, Who Launched a Satellite into Space.” The students and their science teacher were invited to the art exhibition, where a gathering was held to share conversations together.\n![Quiz Show Prize](OSSIQuizshowPresent1.JPG)\n![Quiz Show Prize](OSSIQuizshowPresent2.JPG)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Drawing LIVE](OSSIQuizShow.JPG)\n[grid-2]\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 1](OSSIQuiz1.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 2](OSSIQuiz2.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 3](OSSIQuiz3.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 4](OSSIQuiz4.jpg)\n[/grid]\n[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wArISD9NJ_8)"

The first version, Weapons of Mass Happiness, was a heavy cast-aluminum sphere with a Geiger counter and a printer that outputs messages when triggered by nuclear explosion. The second was built with K-SAD students, featuring letters engraved on cow bones—emphasizing that indestructible data is the ultimate weapon. In 2010, the third version appeared: I Love You. Armored in thick SC45 steel with a piezo sensor inside, it says \"I love you\" when struck with a hammer.",
