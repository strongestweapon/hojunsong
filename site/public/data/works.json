Therefore, even though it was presented in a renowned exhibition such as Art Spectrum, the work was presented in a deliberately approachable and accessible manner. The main idea behind the presentation format was inspired by kiosks found in local community offices and post offices. \nBy encouraging active audience participation—watching videos and solving quizzes—the project aimed to help viewers realize that the technologies discussed in the satellite project are in fact connected to broader themes such as society, politics, and people’s dreams.\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](QuizShowLeeum.jpg)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](OSSIQuizshowPeople.JPG)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Communication Module Capter](OSSIQuizshowPeople2.JPG)\n![Elementary School Field Trip for Satellite Quiz Show](OSSIQuizshowSchool.jpeg)\nBefore the exhibition, more than 100 elementary school students in Seoul sent handwritten letters titled “To Scientist Hojun Song, Who Launched a Satellite into Space.” The students and their science teacher were invited to the art exhibition, where a gathering was held to share conversations together.\n![Quiz Show Prize](OSSIQuizshowPresent1.JPG)\n![Quiz Show Prize](OSSIQuizshowPresent2.JPG)\n![Satellite Quiz Show Drawing LIVE](OSSIQuizShow.JPG)\n[grid-2]\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 1](OSSIQuiz1.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 2](OSSIQuiz2.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 3](OSSIQuiz3.jpg)\n![OSSI Quiz Show Quiz 4](OSSIQuiz4.jpg)\n[/grid]\n[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wArISD9NJ_8)",

The exhibition presents actual fabricated satellite components alongside stories of the people, communities, and online knowledge encountered throughout the production process.",

        "A performance at the opening of MMCA Seoul. Collaborating with actor Taeyoung Kang, actress Eun-ah Suh, and the band Idiotape, the show explored deconstructing the authority of previous artworks to create new ones. It began with LED poets spouting nonsense, moved through improvised confessions via computer chat, calling out every audience member's name, and flower-rope suicides, ending with loud music in the quiet museum. Deliberately clumsy graphics and fake sculptures were displayed prominently while technology stayed hidden. Only 3 of hundreds danced.",
